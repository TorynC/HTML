      <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Toryn Chua, and I am a second-year student at the
        University of Toronto. I am currently expecting to graduate in May 2027
        with a Specialist in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for
        technology and problem-solving, and I'm particularly interested in
        software development, machine learning, web development, and artificial
        intelligence. Throughout my academic journey, I've gained experience
        working on various coding projects, both independently and
        collaboratively, and have honed my skills in programming languages like
        Python and Java. Outside of academics, I'm an active member of the UofT
        community, taking on leadership roles such as Media Director for the
        UofT Malaysian Singaporean Student Association and Peer Mentor for the
        CSSU. I'm always eager to learn new things, take on challenges, and push
        the boundaries of what I can achieve in the tech world. In the future, I
        hope to contribute to innovative projects and make a meaningful impact
        through technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I have several hobbies that I enjoy. These hobbies
        include playing video games, basketball, going to the gym and playing
        the guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that in order to succeed we must collaborate and work
        together. I am excited to continue my journey as a software developer
        and am always open to new opportunities and challenges. Please feel free
        to reach out!
